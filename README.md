# Transformer

## Overview

This repository provides an unofficial implementation of the Transformer neural network architecture using PyTorch. The code is primarily designed for educational purposes and can be adapted for various natural language processing tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and text generation.

## Dataset

The model utilizes the OPUS Books dataset, which is accessible through Hugging Face's datasets library. This dataset offers a rich collection of parallel text corpora in multiple languages, making it suitable for training and evaluating the Transformer model on different language pairs.

## Model Architecture

The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder framework. Both the encoder and decoder employ a stack of identical layers, each containing a multi-head attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to capture complex dependencies and relationships between different elements in the input sequence.

## Training and Evaluation

The code includes training and evaluation scripts that can be used to train the Transformer model on the OPUS Books dataset and assess its performance on a validation set.

This project is an unofficial implementation inspired by the original Transformer paper: *Attention is All You Need* (Vaswani et al., 2017).
